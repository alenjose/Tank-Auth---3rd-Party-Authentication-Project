READ ME FILE for Tank-Auth---3rd-Party-Authentication-Project
-------------------------------------------------------------

Firstly, the project name is rather mouthful. So let me call it
XTA (eXtending Tank Auth).

This small project is based on CodeIgniter framework available
at http://www.codeigniter.com with the original authentication 
system called Tank Auth created by Ilya Konyukhov, which is
available at http://www.konyukhov.com/soft/tank_auth/ 

The objective of XTA is to add third-party authentication mechanisms
to Tank Auth. By third-party authentication mechanisms, I am 
referring to

* Facebook Connect via Open Graph - using your Facebook login details
  instead of registering again via Tank Auth
* Twitter oAuth - using your Twitter account.
* Google FriendConnect

And there are many others (e.g. OpenID).

The initial version of this extension will probably include 
Facebook only, with Twitter and Google coming on shortly.
